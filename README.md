## 📁 Repository Contents

| File/Filename                          | Description |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| `Suricata_Installation_Config.txt`    | Step-by-step installation and configuration details for Suricata from the demonstration. |
| `local.rules.txt`                     | Custom rule set used during the class demo (e.g., EICAR test, SSH fake login, etc.). |
| `Suricata_IDPS_SETUP_Attacks_Demo.txt`| List of attacks/triggers used during the demo and how they were generated. |
| `NOT_DEMO_OTHER_RULES.txt`            | Additional rules not used in class demo, but included for completeness or future use. |

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this repository is to:

- Demonstrate how Suricata can be installed and configured on Linux for IDS/IPS mode.
- Use custom rules to trigger alerts via simulated attacks.
- Provide a documented environment setup and attack workflow that can be replicated.
- Submit the assignment with evidence of configuration, rules, and attack log workflow.

## ⚙️ Demonstration Setup Highlights

- **Platform:** Ubuntu (or similar) virtual machine setup for the class demo.
- **Suricata Version:** As per the installation guide in `Suricata_Installation_Config.txt`.
- **Network Configuration:** Interfaces set for IDS and/or IPS mode as shown in the config file.
- **Custom Rules:** Defined in `local.rules.txt`, including sample signatures like the EICAR test and fake SSH login attempts.
- **Attack Simulation:** Details in `Suricata_IDPS_SETUP_Attacks_Demo.txt` describing how attacks were generated and logged.

## 🧪 How to Use / Reproduce

1. Follow the instructions in `Suricata_Installation_Config.txt` to install and configure Suricata.
2. Place the rules from `local.rules.txt` into your Suricata rule directory (e.g., `/etc/suricata/rules/`).
3. Restart Suricata so that it loads the new rules.
4. Run the attack or trigger workflow documented in `Suricata_IDPS_SETUP_Attacks_Demo.txt`.
5. Review the alerts/logs generated by Suricata to confirm detection of the demonstration attacks.
6. Optionally review `NOT_DEMO_OTHER_RULES.txt` for additional custom rule ideas.
